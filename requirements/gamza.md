## Team Requirements
We aim to analyze various sounds and incorporate them into the Space Invader game to make it more engaging for players.

## Detailed Requirements
- **Main theme(BGM)**: The theme song that plays on the first screen or main title screen of your game to set the tone of the game for the player.(It is an important element that can make or break the first impression of the game)
- **Spaceship and alien interactions**: Alien makes a sound when it touches your fighter.
- **Store**: Sound for the store.
- **Die**: Make sound when you die.
- **Loses health**: Sound when the fighter loses health
- **Game level**: Faster tempo sound for higher difficulty levels, calmer sound for lower difficulty levels.
- **Ending**: Make a sound when you turn off the game or complete the game.

## Dependency
- The variety of systems in the game makes it difficult for the sound team to set sound effects unilaterally, requiring collaboration with other teams.
